import EnumKeyPaths
import SwiftUI

/// A property wrapper type that can designate properties of app state that can be directly
/// bindable in SwiftUI views.
///
/// Along with an action type that conforms to the ``BindableAction`` protocol, this type can be
/// used to safely eliminate the boilerplate that is typically incurred when working with multiple
/// mutable fields on state.
///
/// For example, a settings screen may model its state with the following struct:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct SettingsState {
///     var displayName = ""
///     var isLoading = false
///     var digest = Digest.daily
///     var protectMyPosts = false
///     var enableNotifications = false
///     var sendEmailNotifications = false
///     var sendMobileNotifications = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The majority of these fields should be editable by the view, and in the Composable
/// Architecture this means that each field requires a corresponding action that can be sent to
/// the store. Typically this comes in the form of an enum with a case per field:
///
/// ```swift
/// enum SettingsAction {
///     case digestChanged(Digest)
///     case displayNameChanged(String)
///     case protectMyPostsChanged(Bool)
///     case enableNotificationsChanged(Bool)
///     case sendEmailNotificationsChanged(Bool)
///     case sendMobileNotificationsChanged(Bool)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And we're not even done yet. In the reducer we must now handle each action, which simply
/// replaces the state at each field with a new value:
///
/// ```swift
/// let settingsReducer = Reducer<
///   SettingsState, SettingsAction, SettingsEnvironment
/// > { state, action, environment in
///     switch action {
///
///     case let digestChanged(digest):
///         state.digest = digest
///         return .none
///
///     case let displayNameChanged(displayName):
///         state.displayName = displayName
///         return .none
///
///     case let enableNotificationsChanged(isOn):
///         state.enableNotifications = isOn
///         return .none
///
///     case let protectMyPostsChanged(isOn):
///         state.protectMyPosts = isOn
///         return .none
///
///     case let sendEmailNotificationsChanged(isOn):
///         state.sendEmailNotifications = isOn
///         return .none
///
///     case let sendMobileNotificationsChanged(isOn):
///         state.sendMobileNotifications = isOn
///         return .none
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is a _lot_ of boilerplate for something that should be simple. Luckily, we can
/// dramatically eliminate this boilerplate using `BindableState` and ``BindableAction``.
///
/// First, we can annotate each bindable value of state with the `@BindableState` property
/// wrapper:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct SettingsState {
///
///     var isLoading = false
///
///     @BindableState var displayName = ""
///     @BindableState var digest = Digest.daily
///     @BindableState var protectMyPosts = false
///     @BindableState var enableNotifications = false
///     @BindableState var sendEmailNotifications = false
///     @BindableState var sendMobileNotifications = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Each annotated field is directly to bindable to SwiftUI controls, like pickers, toggles, and
/// text fields. Notably, the `isLoading` property is _not_ annotated as being bindable, which
/// prevents the view from mutating this value directly.
///
/// Next, we can conform the action type to ``BindableAction`` by collapsing all of the
/// individual, field-mutating actions into a single case that holds a ``BindingAction`` generic
/// over the reducer's `SettingsState`:
///
/// ```swift
/// enum SettingsAction: BindableAction {
///     case binding(BindingAction<SettingsState>)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And then, we can simplify the settings reducer by allowing the `binding` method to handle
/// these field mutations for us:
///
/// ```swift
/// let settingsReducer = Reducer<
///     SettingsState, SettingsAction, SettingsEnvironment
/// > {
///     switch action {
///     case .binding:
///         return .none
///     }
/// }
/// .binding()
/// ```
///
/// Binding actions are constructed and sent to the store by calling ``ViewStore/binding(_:)``
/// with a key path to the bindable state:
///
/// ```swift
/// TextField("Display name", text: viewStore.binding(\.$displayName))
/// ```
///
/// Should you need to layer additional functionality over these bindings, your reducer can
/// pattern match the action for a given key path:
///
/// ```swift
/// case .binding(\.$displayName):
///   // Validate display name
///
/// case .binding(\.$enableNotifications):
///   // Return an authorization request effect
/// ```
///
/// Binding actions can also be tested in much the same way regular actions are tested. Rather
/// than send a specific action describing how a binding changed, such as
/// `.displayNameChanged("Blob")`, you will send a ``Reducer/binding(action:)`` action that
/// describes which key path is being set to what value, such as `.set(\.$displayName, "Blob")`:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = TestStore(
///   initialState: SettingsState(),
///   reducer: settingsReducer,
///   environment: SettingsEnvironment(...)
/// )
///
/// store.send(.set(\.$displayName, "Blob")) {
///   $0.displayName = "Blob"
/// }
/// store.send(.set(\.$protectMyPosts, true)) {
///   $0.protectMyPosts = true
/// )
/// ```
