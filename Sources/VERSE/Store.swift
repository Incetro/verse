/// the `scope` method to derive more focused stores that can be passed to subviews

    // MARK: - Scope

    /// Scopes the store to one that exposes local state and actions
    ///
    /// This can be useful for deriving new stores to hand to child views in an application. For
    /// example:
    ///
    ///     // Application state made from local states.
    ///     struct AppState {
    ///         var login: LoginState
    ///         ...
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     struct AppAction {
    ///         case login(LoginAction)
    ///         ...
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     // A store that runs the entire application.
    ///     let store = Store(
    ///         initialState: AppState(),
    ///         reducer: appReducer,
    ///         environment: AppEnvironment()
    ///     )
    ///
    ///     // Construct a login view by scoping the store to one that works with only login domain.
    ///     LoginView(
    ///         store: store.scope(
    ///             state: { $0.login },
    ///             action: { AppAction.login($0) }
    ///         )
    ///     )
    ///
    /// Scoping in this fashion allows you to better modularize your application. In this case,
    /// `LoginView` could be extracted to a module that has no access to `AppState` or `AppAction`
    ///
    /// Scoping also gives a view the opportunity to focus on just the state and actions it cares
    /// about, even if its feature domain is larger
    ///
    /// For example, the above login domain could model a two screen login flow: a login form followed
    /// by a two-factor authentication screen. The second screen's domain might be nested in the
    /// first:
    ///
    ///     struct LoginState: Equatable {
    ///         var email = ""
    ///         var password = ""
    ///         var twoFactorAuth: TwoFactorAuthState?
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     enum LoginAction: Equatable {
    ///         case emailChanged(String)
    ///         case loginButtonTapped
    ///         case loginResponse(Result<TwoFactorAuthState, LoginError>)
    ///         case passwordChanged(String)
    ///         case twoFactorAuth(TwoFactorAuthAction)
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The login view holds onto a store of this domain:
    ///
    ///     struct LoginView: View {
    ///       let store: Store<LoginState, LoginAction>
    ///
    ///       var body: some View { ... }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// If its body were to use a view store of the same domain, this would introduce a number of
    /// problems:
    ///
    /// * The login view would be able to read from `twoFactorAuth` state. This state is only intended
    ///   to be read from the two-factor auth screen
    ///
    /// * Even worse, changes to `twoFactorAuth` state would now cause SwiftUI to recompute
    ///   `LoginView`'s body unnecessarily
    ///
    /// * The login view would be able to send `twoFactorAuth` actions. These actions are only
    ///   intended to be sent from the two-factor auth screen (and reducer)
    ///
    /// * The login view would be able to send non user-facing login actions, like `loginResponse`.
    ///   These actions are only intended to be used in the login reducer to feed the results of
    ///   effects back into the store
    ///
    /// To avoid these issues, one can introduce a view-specific domain that slices off the subset of
    /// state and actions that a view cares about:
    ///
    ///     extension LoginView {
    ///
    ///         struct State: Equatable {
    ///             var email: String
    ///             var password: String
    ///         }
    ///
    ///         enum Action: Equatable {
    ///             case emailChanged(String)
    ///             case loginButtonTapped
    ///             case passwordChanged(String)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// One can also introduce a couple helpers that transform feature state into view state and
    /// transform view actions into feature actions
    ///
    ///     extension LoginState {
    ///         var view: LoginView.State {
    ///             .init(email: self.email, password: self.password)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     extension LoginView.Action {
    ///         var feature: LoginAction {
    ///             switch self {
    ///             case let .emailChanged(email)
    ///                 return .emailChanged(email)
    ///             case .loginButtonTapped:
    ///                 return .loginButtonTapped
    ///             case let .passwordChanged(password)
    ///                 return .passwordChanged(password)
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// With these helpers defined, `LoginView` can now scope its store's feature domain into its view
    /// domain:
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         WithViewStore(
    ///             self.store.scope(
